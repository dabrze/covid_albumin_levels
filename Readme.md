# Reproducible analysis of albumin levels of patients from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China

The main folder contains the R source code (`covid_albumin_analysis.Rmd`) in the form of a knitr notebook and the resulting report in HTML format (`covid_albumin_analysis.html`). If you want to take a look at the report download the html file to your computer or go to https://dabrze.github.io/covid_albumin_levels/.

The rest of the repository is organized as follows:

- the `data` folder contains the source data for this analysis;
- the `plots` folder contains data plots that were used in the accompanying publication.

# Usage

To reproduce the analysis:

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open RStudio and run (*knit*) `covid_albumin_analysis.Rmd`
3. The svg and png versions of the resulting plots will be saved into the `plots` folder
